# 6 DOF Gesture Controlled Robotic Arm

Welcome to the 6 Degrees of Freedom Gesture Controlled Robotic Arm project! This repository contains all the resources, including code, schematics, and documentation, to build and control a robotic arm using hand gestures.

---

## Features

- Gesture Control: Control the robotic arm using hand gestures via MPU6050 sensor.
- 6 Degrees of Freedom: Achieves versatile and precise movements.
- Wireless Communication: Utilizes ESP-NOW for real-time data transmission between the controller and the robotic arm.
- Flex Sensors Integration: Flex sensors are used for finer control of additional functionalities.
- Battery-Powered: Operates using a LiPo 3S battery.
- High Torque Motors: Includes DRV8825 motor drivers and a 16-channel servo driver for robust performance.

## Hardware Components

- Robotic Arm: Custom-built with 6 degrees of freedom.
- ESP32 (x2): One for the gesture controller and another for the robotic arm.
- MPU6050: For gesture sensing.
- Flex Sensors (x3): Connected to GPIO 36, 39, and 34 on the ESP32.
- 16-Channel Servo Driver: To control the servos.
- DRV8825 Motor Driver: For stepper motor control.
- LiPo 3S 2200mAh Battery: Powers the system.
